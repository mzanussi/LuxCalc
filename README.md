Lux Calc provides the stage or screen lighting technician with an easy-to-use and handy lighting calculator at his or her fingertips. With Lux Calc you can quickly calculate:  

- Power Formula: Provide any two known values (such as watts and volts) to calculate the unknown one (amps).  

- Beam Calculations: Variables include beam diameter, beam angle, and throw distance. Input two to figure the third. You can also determine throw distance by inputing a horizontal and a vertical measurement. Supports feet, meters, or any other unit of measurement.  

- Conversions: Determine footcandles from lux, and vice-versa.  

- Voltage Drop: Calculate voltage drop on a copper conductor for a given amperage and wire length. Also calculates wire resistance.

Lux Calc is provided at no cost to the user and without any ads, a true freeware application!   

Please feel free to contact us with suggestions for additional features or improvements.
